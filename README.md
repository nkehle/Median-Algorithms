How to Run: To run the test results, simply run the TestMedian.py file

The run terminal will produce the averages in a table, and then print the standard
deviation below in a separate table.

When it is finished executing (depending on the repeats or array sizes can take up to a min or two), 
a graph should pop up displaying the analysis and the runtimes across the different array sizes.

Notes:
At the time of submission the repeats is set to 100 and array size up to 100,000
